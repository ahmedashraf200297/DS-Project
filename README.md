Bank üèß üí≥ marketing project 

Project Overview

This project involves developing a neural network model for market segmentation based on a variety of factors including demographics, behavior, and other relevant criteria. The process will begin with selecting a dataset,the Bank Marketing Dataset, to explore and understand the customer data available. The initial phase will focus on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the data, examining how different features correlate with each other, and identifying any outliers or missing values that need to be addressed.

Datasets:
- For Bank Marketing Data, the dataset can be found on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing


Steps:

1. Dataset Selection and Preparation: Choose either the Bank Marketing Data or the Online Retail Data for analysis. Download the dataset and prepare it for exploratory data analysis by handling any missing values, outliers, or other inconsistencies.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform a thorough EDA to gain a deep understanding of the dataset. This includes analyzing the distribution of key features, identifying patterns or trends, and understanding the relationship between different variables.

3. Feature Engineering: Based on insights gained from the EDA, engineer new features that could enhance the model's ability to segment the market effectively. This might involve combining features, creating new metrics, or transforming existing variables.

4. Preprocessing for Neural Network: Prepare the data for input into a neural network. This may involve normalizing or scaling the features and encoding categorical variables as necessary.

5. Neural Network Development: Build a neural network model that can segment the market based on the identified features. Choose an appropriate architecture, considering the complexity of the data and the task at hand.

6. Training and Evaluation: Train the neural network on the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance using suitable metrics. Adjust the model's hyperparameters as needed to improve its ability to segment the market accurately.

7. Insights and Market Segmentation: Use the trained neural network to segment the market based on demographics, behavior, and other factors. Analyze the resulting segments to understand the distinct characteristics of each group.

8. Recommendations: Based on the market segmentation, provide recommendations for targeted marketing strategies, product development, or other business strategies that could benefit from understanding the distinct market segments.

9. Documentation: Document the entire process, including the choice of dataset, EDA findings, model development steps, and insights gained from the market segmentation. This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide to the project.
